    <p>Being a Swede, this is something I basically grew up on.</p>
    <p>Served with potatoes, lingonberry jam and sauce. How to make that is another story!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced onion</li>
        <li>1/3 cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>3/4 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/4 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/3 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a frying pan over low heat; cook and stir onion in melted butter until lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix bread crumbs, water, and half-and-half in a large bowl; let stand for about 2 minutes.
         Stir cooked onion, ground beef, ground pork, salt, white pepper, and sugar into bread crumb mixture until thoroughly mixed. Shape mixture into about 48 very small meatballs.</li>
         <li>Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a skillet; add meatballs. Brown slowly, allowing about 25 minutes, until meatballs are fully cooked in the middle and no longer pink. 
         Shake pan occasionally to cook evenly.</li>
    </ol>
